  A small formatting utility around the awesome [kdl-rs](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl-rs) crate for formatting
  KDL files. It is also capable of converting KDL v1 to v2 documents and vice versa.

$ kdl-fmt ./path/to/file.kdl

# format the content of file and write it back into the file
$ kdl-fmt --in-place ./path/to/file.kdl

# format content from STDIN
$ echo "some { kdl; }" | kdl-fmt -

# convert to v1
$ kdl-fmt --to-v1 ./path/to/file.kdl

# convert to v2
$ kdl-fmt --to-v2 ./path/to/file.kdl

# remove comments
$ kdl-fmt --strip-comments ./path/to/file.kdl

# print help
